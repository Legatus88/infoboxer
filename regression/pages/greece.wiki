According to the 2011 census, Greece's population is around 10.8 million. [[Athens]] is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by [[Thessaloniki]], which is commonly referred to as the co-capital.

Greece is strategically located at the crossroads of [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. Situated on the southern tip of the [[Balkan peninsula]], it shares land borders with [[Albania]] to the northwest, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the north and [[Turkey]] to the northeast. Greece consists of nine [[geographic regions of Greece|geographic regions]]: [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Central Greece]], the [[Peloponnese]], [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], the [[Aegean Islands]] (including the [[Dodecanese]] and [[Cyclades]]), [[western Thrace|Thrace]], [[Crete]], and the [[Ionian Islands]]. The [[Aegean Sea]] lies to the east of the [[Geography of Greece|mainland]], the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and the [[list of countries by length of coastline|11th longest coastline in the world]] at {{convert|13676|km|0|abbr=on}} in length, featuring a vast number of [[List of islands of Greece|islands]], of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with [[Mount Olympus]] being the highest peak at {{convert|2918|m|ft}}.

Greece has one of the [[History of Greece|longest histories]] of any country, tracing its roots to the civilization of [[Ancient Greece]], which is considered the cradle of all [[Western culture|Western civilization]]; its legacy includes [[Athenian democracy|democracy]], [[Western philosophy]], the [[Olympic Games]], [[Western literature]],<ref name="Strickland2007">{{cite book|author=Carol Strickland|title=The Illustrated Timeline of Western Literature: A Crash Course in Words & Pictures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qw_7eINO_NcC&pg=PA2|year=2007|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-4860-8|page=2|quote=Although the first writing originates in the cradle of civilization along Middle Eastern rivers — the Tigris, Euphrates, and Nile — the true cradle of Western literature is Athens.

[[Roman Greece|Annexed]] by [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in the second century BCE, Greece became an integral part of the Roman Empire and formed the core of its successor, the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Greece is a [[democracy|democratic]] and [[developed country]] with an advanced [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]], a high [[quality of life]] and a very high [[Human Development Index|standard of living]]. A founding member of the [[United Nations]], Greece was the tenth member to join the [[European Communities]] (precursor to the [[European Union]]) and has been part of the [[Eurozone]] since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]],{{Refn | group = lower-alpha | name="integrated1974" | On 14 August 1974 Greek forces withdrew from the integrated military structure of [[NATO]] in protest at the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus; Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.}}  [[OECD]], [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie|OIF]], [[OSCE]] and the [[WTO]]. Greece, which is one of the world's [[Greek shipping|largest shipping powers]], [[middle power]]s and [[Tourism in Greece|top tourist destinations]], has the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest economy]] in the [[Balkans]], where it is an important regional investor.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Greece}}
The names for the nation of Greece and [[Names of the Greeks|the Greek people]] differ from the names used in other languages, locations and cultures. Although the [[Greeks]] call the country ''{{transl|el|Hellas}}'' or ''{{transl |el|Ellada}}'' ({{lang-el|Ἑλλάς or Ελλάδα}}) and its official name is the Hellenic Republic, in English it is referred to as Greece, which comes from the [[Latin]] term ''{{lang|la|Graecia}}'' as used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], which literally means 'the land of the Greeks', and derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] name [[:wikt:Γραικός|{{lang|el| nocat=true|Γραικός}}]]. However, the name ''{{transl |el|Hellas}}'' is sometimes used in English as well.

The most devastating intra-Greek war was the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404 BC), won by [[Sparta]] and marking the demise of the [[Athenian Empire]] as the leading power in ancient Greece. Both Athens and Sparta were later overshadowed by [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] and eventually [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], with the latter uniting the Greek world in the [[League of Corinth]] (also known as the ''Hellenic League'' or ''Greek League'') under the guidance of [[Phillip II of Macedon|Phillip II]], who was elected leader of the first unified Greek state in history.

Following the assassination of Phillip II, his son [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander III]] ("The Great") assumed the leadership of the League of Corinth and launched an invasion of the Persian Empire with the combined forces of all Greek states in 334 BC. Undefeated in battle, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC. By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the [[Seleucid Empire]], [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] and the [[Indo-Greeks|Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. Many Greeks migrated to [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Seleucia]] and the many other new Hellenistic cities in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian Morris|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf|title=The growth of Greek cities in the first millennium BC|format=PDF|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|date=December 2005}}</ref> Although the political unity of Alexander's empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the [[Hellenistic civilization]] and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Ferguson|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/260307/Hellenistic-Age|title=Hellenistic Age: Ancient Greek history|publisher=Online Encyclopaedia Britannica|work=britannica.com|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> Greek science, technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Cynthia | last1 = Kosso | first2 = Anne | last2 = Scott | title = The Nature and Function of Water, Baths, Bathing, and Hygiene from Antiquity Through the Renaissance | publisher =

Similarly, most Roman emperors maintained an admiration for things Greek in nature. The [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]] visited Greece in AD 66, and performed at the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], despite the rules against non-Greek participation. [[Hadrian]] was also particularly fond of the Greeks; before he became emperor he served as an [[eponymous archon]] of Athens.

The Roman Empire in the east, following the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Empire in the west]] in the 5th century, is conventionally known as the Byzantine Empire (but was simply called "Roman Empire" in its own time) and lasted until 1453. With its capital in [[Constantinople]], its language and literary culture was Greek and its religion was predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Byzantine Studies |editor-last=Jeffreys |editor-first=Elizabeth |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-925246-6 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liFKua_cWL8C&pg=PA4&dq=byzantine+predominantly+greek+culturally&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QOucT52cL8Sm0AXG3cX2Dg&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=byzantine%20predominantly%20greek%20culturally&f=false |accessdate=29 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130606230132/https://books.google.com/books?id=liFKua_cWL8C&pg=PA4&dq=byzantine+predominantly+greek+culturally&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QOucT52cL8Sm0AXG3cX2Dg&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBg |archivedate=6 June 2013 }}</ref>

From the 4th century, the Empire's Balkan territories, including Greece, suffered from the dislocation of the ''[[Migration Period|Barbarian Invasions]]''. The raids and devastation of the [[Goths]] and [[Huns]] in the 4th and 5th centuries and the [[South Slavs|Slavic]] invasion of Greece in the 7th century resulted in a dramatic collapse in imperial authority in the Greek peninsula.{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 35–6}} Following the Slavic invasion, the imperial government retained formal control of only the islands and coastal areas, particularly the densely populated walled cities such as Athens, Corinth and Thessalonica, while some mountainous areas in the interior held out on their own and continued to recognize imperial authority.{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 35–6}} Outside of these areas, a limited amount of Slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred, although on a much smaller scale than previously thought.{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 63–6}}<ref>{{Citation | first = TE | last = Gregory | title = A History of Byzantium | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 2010 | page = 169 | quote = It is now generally agreed that the people who lived in the Balkans after the Slavic "invasions" were probably for the most part the same as those who had lived there earlier, although the creation of new political groups and arrival of small immigrants caused people to look at themselves as distinct from their neighbors, including the Byzantines.}}</ref>

While most of mainland Greece and the Aegean islands was under Ottoman control by the end of the 15th century, [[Cyprus]] and [[Crete]] remained [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] territory and did not fall to the Ottomans until 1571 and 1670 respectively. The only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped long-term Ottoman rule was the [[Ionian Islands]], which remained Venetian until their capture by the [[First French Republic]] in 1797, then passed to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1809 until their unification with Greece in 1864.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}}

While Greeks in the Ionian Islands and [[Constantinople]] lived in prosperity, and Greeks living in Constantinople achieved positions of power within the Ottoman administration,{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}} much of the population of mainland Greece suffered the economic consequences of the Ottoman conquest. Heavy taxes were enforced, and in later years the Ottoman Empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates, effectively turning the rural Greek populations into [[serfdom|serfs]].<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Kourvetaris | first1 = George | last2 = Dobratz | first2 = Betty | title = A profile of modern Greece: in search of identity | page = 33 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ePwcAAAAYAAJ&q=Greece+chiflik+serfs&dq=Greece+chiflik+serfs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1bnkT-GfAcix0QXl9biBCQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1987}}</ref>

The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] were considered by the Ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] population of the Ottoman Empire, whether ethnically Greek or not. Although the Ottoman state did not force non-Muslims to convert to [[Islam]], Christians faced several types of discrimination intended to highlight their inferior status in the Ottoman Empire. Discrimination against Christians, particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local Ottoman authorities, led to conversions to Islam, if only superficially. In the 19th century, many "crypto-Christians" returned to their old religious allegiance.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}}

[[File:White Tower Thessaloniki 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[White Tower of Thessaloniki]], one of the best-known Ottoman structures remaining in Greece]]
The nature of Ottoman administration of Greece varied, though it was invariably arbitrary and often harsh.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}} Some cities had governors appointed by the [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]], while others (like Athens) were self-governed municipalities.

When military conflicts broke out between the Ottoman Empire and other states, Greeks usually took arms against the Empire, with few exceptions. Prior to the Greek revolution, there had been a number of wars which saw Greeks fight against the Ottomans, such as the Greek participation in the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the [[Dionysius the Philosopher|Epirus peasants' revolts]] of 1600–1601, the [[Morean War]] of 1684–1699, and the [[Russian Empire|Russian]]-instigated [[Orlov Revolt]] in 1770, which aimed at breaking up the Ottoman Empire in favor of Russian interests.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}} These uprisings were put down by the Ottomans with great bloodshed.<ref>{{Citation | first = Lyn | last = Harrington | title = Greece and the Greeks | page = 124 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d7BAAAAAIAAJ&q=greece+revolts+ottoman+rule+bloodshed&dq=greece+revolts+ottoman+rule+bloodshed&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BI61T4PPBaWMiAKw79nQBg&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBg | publisher = T Nelson | year = 1968}}, 221 pp.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first1 = Jamie | last1 = Stokes | first2 = Anthony | last2 = Gorman | title = Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East | page = 256 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&pg=PA256&dq=greece+ottoman+rule+revolts+orlov&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XIi1T8O8J8nPiAKhwZiHBw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=greece%20ottoman%20rule%20revolts%20orlov&f=false | publisher = Infobase | year = 2010 | ISBN = 978-1-4381-2676-0}}</ref>

The 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as something of a "dark age" in Greek history, with the prospect of overthrowing Ottoman rule appearing remote with only the Ionian islands remaining free of Turkish domination. [[Corfu]] withstood three major sieges in [[Siege of Corfu (1537)|1537]], 1571 and [[Siege of Corfu (1716)#The Siege of Corfu|1716]] all of which resulted in the repulsion of the Ottomans. However, in the 18th century, there arose through shipping a wealthy and dispersed Greek merchant class. These merchants came to dominate trade within the Ottoman Empire, establishing communities throughout the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and Western Europe. Though the Ottoman conquest had cut Greece off from significant European intellectual movements such as the [[Reformation]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], these ideas together with the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] and [[romantic nationalism]] began to penetrate the Greek world via the mercantile diaspora.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}} In the late 18th century, [[Rigas Feraios]], the first revolutionary to envision an independent Greek state, published a series of documents relating to Greek independence, including but not limited to a national anthem and the first detailed map of Greece, in [[Vienna]], and was murdered by Ottoman agents in 1798.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}}<ref>{{Citation | first = Olga | last = Katsiaridi-Hering | contribution = La famiglia nell'economia europea, secc.

In 1814, a secret organization called the [[Filiki Eteria]] (Society of Friends) was founded with the aim of liberating Greece. The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolution in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Danubian Principalities]] and [[Constantinople]]. The first of these revolts began on 6 March 1821 in the Danubian Principalities under the leadership of [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792–1828)|Alexandros Ypsilantis]], but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north spurred the Greeks of the Peloponnese into action and on 17 March 1821 the [[Maniots]] declared war on the Ottomans.<ref name="Brewer, D. 2001, pp. 235">Brewer, D.

By the end of the month, the Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Ottomans and by October 1821 the Greeks under [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] had captured [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. The Peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in [[Crete]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Central Greece]], which would soon be suppressed. Meanwhile, the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the Ottoman navy in the [[Aegean Sea]] and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea. In 1822 and 1824 the Turks and Egyptians ravaged the islands, including [[Chios Massacre|Chios]] and [[Destruction of Psara|Psara]], committing wholesale [[Massacres during the Greek Revolution|massacres]] of the population.<ref name="Brewer, D. 2001, pp. 235" /> This had the effect of galvanizing public opinion in western Europe in favor of the Greek rebels.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}}

Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Sultan]] negotiated with [[Mehmet Ali of Egypt]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success: by the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control, and the city of [[Missolonghi]]—put under siege by the Turks since April 1825—fell in April 1826. Although Ibrahim was defeated in [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]], he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese and [[Athens]] had been retaken.

After years of negotiation, three Great Powers, [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Bourbon Restoration|France]], decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at [[Pylos|Navarino]]. After a week-long standoff, a [[Battle of Navarino|battle]] began which resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet. A [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary force]] was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the Egyptian army from the Peloponnese, while the Greeks proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828. As a result of years of negotiation, the [[First Hellenic Republic|nascent Greek state]] was finally recognized under the [[London Protocol (1830)|London Protocol]] in 1830.

[[File:Greekhistory.GIF|thumb|right|300px|The territorial evolution of [[Kingdom of Greece]] until 1947.]]

In 1827, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], from [[Corfu]], was chosen as the first governor of the [[First Hellenic Republic]]. Following his assassination in 1831 and the subsequent [[London Conference of 1832|conference a year later]], the [[Great Power]]s of Britain, France and Russia installed Bavarian Prince [[Otto of Greece|Otto von Wittelsbach]] as [[Kingdom of Greece|monarch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Otto-king-of-Greece|title=Otto: King of Greece|publisher=Online Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> In 1843 an uprising forced the king to grant a constitution and a representative assembly.

Due to his authoritarian rule, he was eventually dethroned in 1862 and a year later replaced by Prince Wilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name [[George I of Greece|George I]] and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain. In 1877 [[Charilaos Trikoupis]], who is credited with significant improvement of the country's infrastructure, curbed the power of the monarchy to interfere in the assembly by issuing the rule of [[Motion of no confidence|vote of confidence]] to any potential prime minister.

Corruption and Trikoupis' increased spending to create necessary infrastructure like the [[Corinth Canal]] overtaxed the weak Greek economy, forcing the declaration of [[Sovereign default|public insolvency]] in 1893 and to accept the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country's debtors. Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called [[Modern Greek|Demotic]]. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of [[Ancient Greek]].

Government documents and newspapers were consequently published in ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified) Greek, a form which few ordinary Greeks could read. Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language, but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts, to the extent that, when the [[New Testament]] was translated into Demotic in 1901, riots erupted in Athens and the government fell (the ''Evangeliaka''). This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s.

All Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the Greek-speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire, regardless of the dialect they spoke. Especially in [[Crete]], a [[Cretan Revolt (1866–1869)|prolonged revolt in 1866–1869]] had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russia and the Ottomans in 1877]], Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia's side, but Greece was too poor, and too concerned of British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881, [[Thessaly]] and small parts of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] were ceded to Greece as part of the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]], while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete.

Greeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]] the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans. Through the intervention of the Great Powers however, Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey, while Crete was established as an [[Cretan State|autonomous state]] under [[Prince George of Greece]].

[[File:Accession of Greece to the European Union.png|thumb|200px|Signing at [[Zappeion]] of the documents for the accession of Greece to the [[European Union|European Communities]] in 1979.]]

At the end of the [[Balkan Wars]], the extent of Greece's territory and population had increased.  In the following years, the struggle between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and charismatic Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] over the country's foreign policy on the eve of World War I dominated the country's political scene, and divided the country into [[National Schism|two opposing groups]].  During parts of the First World War, Greece had two governments; a royalist pro-German government in [[Athens]] and a Venizelist pro-Britain one in [[Thessaloniki]].  The two governments were united in 1917, when Greece officially entered the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]].

In the aftermath of the First World War, Greece attempted further expansion into [[Asia Minor]], a region with a large native Greek population at the time, but was defeated in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922]], contributing to a massive flight of [[Ottoman Greeks|Asia Minor Greeks]].<ref name=Gibney>{{cite book |author=Matthew J.

The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. The exchange was part of the terms of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] which ended the war.<ref>{{cite web|author=Annette Grossbongardt|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/christians-in-turkey-the-diaspora-welcomes-the-pope-a-451140.html|title=Christians in Turkey: The Diaspora Welcomes the Pope|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=28 November 2006}}</ref>

The following era was marked by instability, as over 1.5 million propertyless Greek refugees from Turkey had to be integrated into Greek society. Because the term "Greeks" in the exchange was based on religion [[Cappadocian Greeks]], [[Pontian Greeks]], and [[Antiochian Greeks|non Greek followers of Greek Orthodoxy]] were all subject to the exchange as well. Many of these refugees couldn't even speak the language, and were from alien environments, such as the case of the non Greeks and Cappadocians. The refugees also made a dramatic post war population boost, as the amount of refugees was more than a quarter of Greece's prior population.<ref>Howland, Charles P. [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/68710/charles-p-howland/greece-and-her-refugees "Greece and Her Refugees"], ''Foreign Affairs,'' [[The Council on Foreign Relations]]. July 1926.</ref> The task was undertaken by settling the Pontians and Cappadocians in the Macedonian mountains, where they would adapt better, and settling the Demotic speakers and non Greeks in the Greek Isles and cities, where they were already adapted to.

Following the catastrophic events in Asia Minor, the monarchy was abolished [[Greek republic referendum, 1924|via a referendum]] in 1924 and the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] was declared.  Premier [[Georgios Kondylis]] took power in 1935 and effectively abolished the republic by bringing back the monarchy via [[Greek monarchy referendum, 1935|a referendum]] in 1935.  A [[coup d'état]] followed in 1936 and installed [[Ioannis Metaxas]] as the head of a dictatorial regime known as the [[4th of August Regime]].  Although a dictatorship, Greece remained on good terms with Britain and was not allied with the Axis.

On 28 October 1940, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] demanded the surrender of Greece, but the Greek administration refused and in the following [[Greco-Italian War]], Greece repelled Italian forces into Albania, giving the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] their first victory over [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces on land. The Greek struggle and victory against the Italians received exuberant praise at the time. Most prominent is the quote of [[Winston Churchill]]:
<blockquote>''"Hence we will not say that [[Greeks]] fight like heroes, but we will say that heroes fight like Greeks."''<ref>{{cite video |people=Pilavios, Konstantinos (Director); Tomai, Fotini (Texts & Presentation) |date=25 October 2010 |title=The Heroes Fight like Greeks&nbsp;– Greece during the Second World War |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvDTDbqMzI4#t=51s |medium=Motion Picture |language= Greek |publisher=Service of Diplomatic and Historical Archives of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs |location= Athens |archivedate= |accessdate=28 October 2010|time= 51 sec |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref></blockquote> French general [[Charles de Gaulle]] was among those who praised the fierceness of the Greek resistance. In an official notice released to coincide with the Greek national celebration of the Day of Independence, De Gaulle expressed his admiration for the heroic Greek resistance: <blockquote>''"In the name of the captured yet still alive [[French people]], [[France]] wants to send her greetings to the [[Greeks|Greek people]] who are fighting for their freedom. The 25 March 1941 finds Greece in the peak of their heroic struggle and in the top of their glory. Since the [[Battle of Salamis]], Greece had not achieved the greatness and the glory which today holds."''<ref>Fafalios and Hadjipateras, p. 157</ref></blockquote> The country would eventually fall to urgently dispatched German forces during the [[Battle of Greece]], despite the fierce Greek resistance particularly in the [[Battle of the Metaxas Line]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] himself recognised the bravery and the courage of the [[Greek army]], stating in his address to the Reichstag on 11 December 1941, that: <blockquote>"''Historical justice obliges me to state that of the enemies who took up positions against us, the [[Greeks|Greek]] soldier particularly fought with the highest courage. He capitulated only when further resistance had become impossible and useless.''"<ref>{{Cite wikisource |last=Hitler |first= Adolf |authorlink= Adolf Hitler |title= Address to the Reichstag | date = 11 December 1941 |ref= harv}}</ref></blockquote>

Greece was eventually occupied by the [[Nazis]] who proceeded to administer [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]], while other regions of the country were given to Nazi Germany's partners, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Bulgaria]]. The occupation brought about terrible hardships for the Greek civilian population. Over 100,000 civilians died of [[starvation]] during the winter of 1941–1942, tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by Nazis and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II#Greece|collaborators]], the country's economy was ruined and the great majority of [[History of the Jews in Greece|Greek Jews]] were deported and murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244154/Greece/26430/Greek-history-since-World-War-IGreece | contribution = Greek history since World War I | title = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref><ref name="Mazower 2001, p. 155">Mazower (2001), p. 155</ref> The [[Greek Resistance]], one of the most effective resistance movements in [[Europe]] fought vehemently against the Nazis and their collaborators. The [[Nazi Germany|German occupiers]] committed [[German war crimes#Greece|numerous atrocities, mass executions, and wholesale slaughter of civilians and destruction of towns and villages]] in reprisals. In the course of the concerted anti-guerrilla campaign, hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost 1,000,000 Greeks left homeless.<ref name="Mazower 2001, p. 155"/> In total, the Germans executed some 21,000 Greeks, the Bulgarians 40,000 and the Italians 9,000.<ref>Knopp (2009), p. 193</ref>

After liberation, Greece experienced a polarising [[Greek Civil War|civil war]] between communist and [[anticommunist]] forces, which led to economic devastation and severe social tensions between [[right-wing politics|rightists]] and largely communist [[left-wing politics|leftists]] for the next thirty years.<ref>[[Mark Mazower|Mazower, Mark]].  ''After the War was Over''.</ref>  The next twenty years were characterized by marginalisation of the left in the political and social spheres but also by [[Greek economic miracle|rapid economic growth]], propelled in part by the [[Marshall Plan]].

King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]]'s [[Apostasia of 1965|dismissal]] of [[George Papandreou (senior)|George Papandreou]]'s centrist government in July 1965 prompted a prolonged period of political turbulence which culminated in a ''coup d'état'' on 21 April 1967 by the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Regime of the Colonels]]. The brutal suppression of the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] on 17 November 1973 sent shockwaves through the regime, and a counter-coup established [[Brigadier]] [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]] as dictator.  On 20 July 1974, as [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkey invaded the island of Cyprus]], the regime collapsed.

The former prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] was invited back from Paris where he had lived in self-exile since 1963, marking the beginning of the [[Metapolitefsi]] era.  The first multiparty [[Greek legislative election, 1974|elections]] since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising.  A democratic and republican [[Constitution of Greece|constitution]] was promulgated on 11 June 1975 following a [[Greek republic referendum, 1974|referendum]] which chose to not restore the monarchy.

Meanwhile, [[Andreas Papandreou]] founded the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) in response to Karamanlis's conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, with the two political formations alternating in government ever since.  Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.<ref name="AdamHartDavis">History, Editorial Consultant: Adam Hart-Davis. [[Dorling Kindersley]].  ISBN 978-1-85613-062-2.</ref> Greece became the tenth member of the [[European Communities]] (subsequently subsumed by the [[European Union]]) on 1 January 1981, ushering in a period of sustained growth.  Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping and a fast-growing service sector raised the country's standard of living to unprecedented levels.  Traditionally strained [[Greek–Turkish relations|relations with neighbouring Turkey]] [[Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy|improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999]], leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against Turkey's [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|bid]] for EU membership.

The [[Greek government-debt crisis]], subsequent [[austerity|austerity policies]] and [[2010–2012 Greek protests|resultant protests]] have agitated domestic politics and have regularly threatened European and global financial markets since the crisis began in 2010.

Eighty percent of Greece consists of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe. [[Mount Olympus]], the mythical abode of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek Gods]], culminates at Mytikas peak {{convert|2918|m|ft}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympusfd.gr/us/infos.asp |title=Olympus the First National Park |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2008 |website=Management Agency of Olympus National Park |publisher=Management Agency of Olympus National Park |access-date=5 December 2015}}</ref> the highest in the country. Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the [[Pindus]] mountain range. The Pindus, a continuation of the [[Dinaric Alps]], reaches a maximum elevation of {{convert|2637|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at [[Smolikas|Mt. Smolikas]] (the second-highest in Greece) and historically has been a significant barrier to east-west travel.

The Pindus range continues through the central Peloponnese, crosses the islands of [[Kythera]] and Antikythera and finds its way into southwestern Aegean, in the island of Crete where it eventually ends.  The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland.  Pindus is characterized by its high, steep peaks, often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes.  The spectacular [[Vikos Gorge]], part of the [[Vikos-Aoos National Park]] in the Pindus range, is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world.<ref>{{cite book | title=Guinness World Records 2005: Special 50th Anniversary Edition | publisher=Guinness World Records | year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D4wYAAAAIAAJ&dq=Vikos%2BGuines | isbn= 978-1-892051-22-6| page = 52}}</ref>  Another notable formation are the [[Meteora]] rock pillars, atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries.

Northeastern Greece features another high-altitude mountain range, the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] range, spreading across the region of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]]; this area is covered with vast, thick, ancient forests, including the famous Dadia forest in the [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros regional unit]], in the far northeast of the country.

Extensive plains are primarily located in the regions of [[Thessaly]], [[Central Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace|Thrace]].  They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country.  Rare marine species such as the pinniped seals and the [[loggerhead sea turtle]] live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece, while its dense forests are home to the endangered [[brown bear]], the [[lynx]], the [[roe deer]] and the wild goat.

===Islands===
{{main|List of islands of Greece}}
Greece features a [[List of islands of Greece|vast number of islands]], between 1,200 and 6,000, depending on the definition,<ref>{{cite book |last=Marker, Sherry; Bowman, John; Kerasiotis, Peter; Sarna, Heidi |title= Frommer's Greek Islands |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2010  |page=12 |isbn= 978-0-470-52664-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvlP7D9C_7gC&pg=PA12}}</ref> 227 of which are inhabited.  Crete is the largest and most populous island; [[Euboea]], separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide [[Euripus Strait]], is the second largest, followed by [[Lesbos]] and [[Rhodes]].

The Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters:  The [[Argo-Saronic Islands]] in the Saronic gulf near Athens, the Cyclades, a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea, the [[North Aegean islands]], a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey, the Dodecanese, another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey, the [[Sporades]], a small tight group off the coast of northeast Euboea, and the Ionian Islands, located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea.

=== Climate ===
{{Further|Climate of Greece}}
[[File:Mytikas.jpg|thumb|220px|A view of [[Mount Olympus]], the highest mountain in Greece and mythical abode of the [[Gods of Olympus]]]]

The [[climate of Greece]] is primarily [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], featuring mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  This climate occurs at all coastal locations, including Athens, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands and parts of the Central Continental Greece region.  The [[Pindus]] mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country, as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on average (due to greater exposure to south-westerly systems bringing in moisture) than the areas lying to the east of the range (due to a [[rain shadow]] effect).

The mountainous areas of Northwestern Greece (parts of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], [[Central Greece]], [[Thessaly]], [[Western Macedonia]]) as well as in the mountainous central parts of Peloponnese&nbsp;– including parts of the regional units of [[Achaea]], [[Arcadia]] and [[Laconia]]&nbsp;– feature an [[Alpine climate]] with heavy snowfalls.  The inland parts of northern Greece, in Central Macedonia and [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] feature a [[temperate climate]] with cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers with frequent thunderstorms.  Snowfalls occur every year in the mountains and northern areas, and brief snowfalls are not unknown even in low-lying southern areas, such as Athens.

=== Ecology ===
[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Greece belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the East Mediterranean province of the [[Mediterranean Region]] and the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]].  According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of Greece can be subdivided into six [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Illyrian deciduous forests]], [[Pindus Mountains mixed forests]], [[Balkan mixed forests]], Rhodope montane mixed forests, Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests and Crete Mediterranean forests.

Since the restoration of democracy, the Greek party system has been dominated by the liberal-conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND) and the social-democratic [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK).{{Refn | group = lower-alpha | For a diachronic analysis of the Greek party system see {{Harvnb | Pappas | 2003 | pp = 90–114}}, who distinguishes three distinct types of party system which developed in consecutive order, namely, a predominant-party system (from 1952 to 1963), a system of polarised pluralism (between 1963 and 1981), and a two-party system (since 1981).}}  Other significant parties include the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE), the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA) the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] (LAOS) and the [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Popular Association&nbsp;– Golden Dawn]].

In 2010, two new parties split off from ND and SYRIZA, the centrist-liberal [[Democratic Alliance (Greece)|Democratic Alliance]] (DS) and the moderate leftist [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (DA). [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]], president of PASOK, won the [[Greek legislative election, 2009|parliamentary elections of October 2009]] with a majority in the Parliament of 160 out of 300 seats.

Since the beginning of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|government-debt crisis]] in 2009, the two major parties, New Democracy and PASOK, have seen a sharp decline in the share of votes in polls conducted, with recent polls showing support from 34% to 48% for the two major parties.<ref name="Political Climate and Governance December 2011">{{cite news | place = GR | url = http://www.vprc.gr/uplds/File/teleytaia%20nea/Epikaira/Political%20Climate%20and%20Governance_December2011.pdf | format = PDF | title = Πολιτική Συγκυρία & Διακυβέρνηση | trans_title = Political climate & governance | date= 22 December 2011 | work = VPRC |accessdate=22 December 2011}}{{Dead link|date=September 2015}}</ref><ref name="Political Climate and Governance January 2012">{{cite news | format = PDF | url = http://www.eklogika.gr/uploads/files/Dimoskopiseis/Political_Conjuncture_and_Governance_Jan2012.pdf | title = Πολιτική Συγκυρία & Διακυβέρνηση | trans_title = Political conjuncture & governance | place = GR | date = 26 January 2012 | work = VPRC |accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="Panhellenic Research for ET3">{{cite news | format = PDF | url = http://www.eklogika.gr/uploads/files/Dimoskopiseis/ToThePoint-Ert3_30-1-12.pdf |title = Πανελλαδικη Ερευνα για την ET3 | date = 29 January 2012 | work = To The Point |accessdate=29 January 2012 |place = GR}}</ref><ref name="Research from Pulse RC for Pontiki">{{cite news | publisher = Ek logika | place = GR | url = http://www.eklogika.gr/uploads/files/Dimoskopiseis/PulseRC-ToPontiki_2-2-2012.pdf | title = Ερευνα της Pulse RC για το Ποντικι |date=2 February 2012 |work=Pulse RC |accessdate=2 February 2012 |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="Varometro Feb 2011">{{cite news |format=PDF |url=http://www.eklogika.gr/uploads/files/Dimoskopiseis/varometro_2_12.pdf |title = Πολιτικό Βαρόμετρο 99 | trans_title = Political barometer |date=7 February 2012 |work= Public Issue | publisher = Ek logika | place = GR |accessdate=7 February 2011}}</ref> Polls show support for PASOK ranging from 8%<ref name="Varometro Feb 2011" /> to 18%,<ref name="Political Climate and Governance December 2011" /> while New Democracy is in the 18% to 30% range.<ref name="Political Climate and Governance December 2011" /><ref name="Panhellenic Research for ET3" />

In November 2011, the two major parties joined the smaller [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] in a [[grand coalition]], pledging their parliamentary support for a [[government of national unity]] headed by former [[European Central Bank]] vice-president [[Lucas Papademos]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Lucas Papademos named as new Greek prime minister |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15671354 |publisher=BBC |work=News |date=10 November 2011 |location=UK |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> [[Panos Kammenos]] voted against this government and he split off from ND forming [[Independent Greeks]].

The coalition government led the country to the [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|parliamentary elections of May 2012]]. The power of the traditional Greek political parties, [[PASOK]] and [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]], declined from 43% to 13% and from 33% to 18%, respectively, due to their support on the politics of [[memorandum|Mnimonio]] and the austerity measures. The leftist party of SYRIZA became the second major party, with an increase from 4% to 16%. No party could form a sustainable government, which led to the [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|parliamentary elections of June 2012]]. The result of the second elections was the formation of a coalition government composed of [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (29%), [[PASOK]] (12%) and [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (6%) parties.

[[Alexis Tsipras]] led Syriza to victory in the [[greek legislative election, January 2015|general election]] held on 25 January 2015, falling short of an outright majority in Parliament by just two seats. The following morning, Tsipras reached an agreement with the [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] [[Independent Greeks]] party to form a coalition, and he was sworn in as Prime Minister of Greece.

=== Law and justice ===
{{Main|Judicial system of Greece|Law enforcement in Greece}}

The [[Judicial system of Greece|Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature and comprises three Supreme Courts: the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]] (Άρειος Πάγος), the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] (Συμβούλιο της Επικρατείας) and the [[Chamber of Accounts (Greece)|Court of Auditors]] (Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο).  The Judiciary system is also composed of civil courts, which judge civil and penal cases and administrative courts, which judge disputes between the citizens and the Greek administrative authorities.

The [[Hellenic Police]] ({{lang-el|Ελληνική Αστυνομία}}) is the national [[police|police force]] of Greece. It is a very large agency with its responsibilities ranging from [[road traffic control]] to [[counter-terrorism]]. It was established in 1984 under Law 1481/1-10-1984 (Government Gazette 152 A) as the result of the fusion of the [[Hellenic Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]] (Χωροφυλακή, ''Chorofylaki'') and the [[Cities Police]] (Αστυνομία Πόλεων, ''Astynomia Poleon'') forces.<ref>Law 1481/1 October 1984, ''Official Journal of the Hellenic Republic'', A-152</ref>

The Hellenic Armed Forces are overseen by the [[Hellenic National Defense General Staff]] (Greek: Γενικό Επιτελείο Εθνικής Άμυνας&nbsp;– ΓΕΕΘΑ), with civilian authority vested in the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]]. It consists of three branches:
* [[Hellenic Army]]
* [[Hellenic Navy]]
* [[Hellenic Air Force]]

Moreover, Greece maintains the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] for law enforcement at sea, search and rescue, and port operations. Though it can support the navy during wartime, it resides under the authority of the [[Ministry of Shipping (Greece)|Ministry of Shipping]].

[[Conscription in Greece|Greece has universal compulsory military service]] for males, while females are exempted from conscription but may otherwise serve in the military. {{As of|2009}}, mandatory military service is nine months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. Additionally, Greek males between the age of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard. However, as the military has sought to become a completely professional force, the government has promised to reduce mandatory military service or abolish it completely.

As a member of [[NATO]], the Greek military participates in exercises and deployments under the auspices of the alliance.

Greece spends over 7 billion USD every year on its military, or 2.3% of GDP, the [[List of countries by military expenditures|24th-highest in the world]].

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Greece}}
Since the [[Kallikratis programme]] reform entered into effect on 1 January 2011, Greece has consisted of thirteen [[modern regions of Greece|regions]] subdivided into a total of 325 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]]. The 54 old [[Prefectures of Greece|prefectures and prefecture-level administrations]] have been largely retained as ''[[regional units of Greece|sub-units]]'' of the regions.  Seven [[Decentralized administrations of Greece|decentralized administrations]] group one to three regions for administrative purposes on a regional basis. There is also one [[autonomous area]], [[Mount Athos]] ({{lang-el|Agio Oros}}, "Holy Mountain"), which borders the region of [[Central Macedonia]].

According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' credits given to European governments were disguised as "swaps" and consequently did not get registered as debt.  As Eurostat at the time ignored statistics involving financial derivatives, a German derivatives dealer had commented to ''Der Spiegel'' that "The Maastricht rules can be circumvented quite legally through swaps," and "In previous years, Italy used a similar trick to mask its true debt with the help of a different US bank."<ref name="Der Spiegel" />  These conditions had enabled Greek as well as many other European governments to spend beyond their means, while meeting the deficit targets of the European Union.<ref name=Goldman /><ref>{{cite news| title = Wall St. Helped To Mask Debt Fueling Europe's Crisis |work=The New York Times | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/business/global/14debt.html?pagewanted=1&hp |date=14 February 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010 |author=Story, Louise; Thomas Jr, Landon; Schwartz, Nelson D.}}</ref>

As a consequence, there was a crisis in international confidence in Greece's ability to repay its sovereign debt.  To avert such a default, in May 2010 the other Eurozone countries, and the IMF, agreed to a rescue package which involved giving Greece an immediate €{{Nowrap|45 billion}} in loans, with more funds to follow, totaling €{{Nowrap|110 billion}}.<ref>{{cite news|author=Thesing, Gabi; Krause-Jackson, Flavia |title= Greece Faces 'Unprecedented' Cuts as $159B Rescue Nears |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-02/greece-faces-unprecedented-cuts-as-159b-rescue-nears.html | publisher=Bloomberg |date=3 May 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Kerin Hope |title= EU Puts Positive Spin on Greek Rescue |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08a87e4e-55c4-11df-b835-00144feab49a.html |work=Financial Times  |date=2 May 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref>  To secure the funding, Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control.<ref>{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Rick|title=Lessons for Congress From the Chaos in Greece|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/rick-newman/2011/11/03/lessons-for-congress-from-the-chaos-in-greece|accessdate=3 November 2011|newspaper=US News|date=3 November 2011}}</ref>

Since the 1980s, the road and rail network of Greece has been significantly modernized.  Important works include the [[Egnatia Odos (modern road)|A2 (Egnatia Odos)]] motorway, that connects northwestern Greece ([[Igoumenitsa]]) with northern and northeastern Greece ([[Kipoi, Evros|Kipoi]]); and the [[Rio–Antirrio bridge]], the longest suspension cable bridge in Europe ({{convert|2250|m|0|abbr=on}} long), connecting the Peloponnese from [[Rio, Greece|Rio]] ({{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Patras]]) with [[Antirrio]] in Central Greece.

Important projects that are currently underway include, the conversion of the [[Greek National Road 8A|GR-8A]], connecting Athens with Patras and further towards [[Pyrgos, Ilia|Pyrgos]] in the western Peloponnese, into a modernised motorway throughout its length (scheduled to be completed by 2014); upgrading unfinished sections of motorway on the [[Motorway 1 (Greece)|A1]], connecting Athens to [[Thessaloniki]]; and the construction of the [[Thessaloniki Metro]].

The Athens Metropolitan Area in particular is served by some of the most modern and efficient transport infrastructure in Europe, such as the [[Athens International Airport]], the privately run [[Attiki Odos]] motorway network and the expanded [[Athens Metro]] system.

Most of the Greek islands and many main cities of Greece are connected by air mainly from the two major Greek airlines, [[Olympic Air]] and [[Aegean Airlines]].  Maritime connections have been improved with modern high-speed craft, including [[hydrofoils]] and [[catamarans]].

Railway connections play a somewhat lesser role in Greece than in many other European countries, but they too have also been expanded, with new suburban/[[commuter rail]] connections, serviced by [[Proastiakos]] around Athens, towards its airport, [[Kiato]] and [[Chalcis|Chalkida]]; around Thessaloniki, towards the cities of [[Larissa]] and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]]; and around Patras.  A modern intercity rail connection between Athens and Thessaloniki has also been established, while an upgrade to double lines in many parts of the {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}} network is underway.  International railway lines connect Greek cities with the rest of Europe, the Balkans and Turkey.

In 2003, public spending on [[research and development]] (R&D) was 456.37 million euros (12.6% increase from 2002). Total R&D spending (both public and private) as a percentage of GDP had increased considerably since the beginning of the past decade, from 0.38% in 1989, to 0.65% in 2001.

R&D spending in Greece remained lower than the EU average of 1.93%, but, according to Research DC, based on OECD and Eurostat data, between 1990 and 1998, total R&D expenditure in Greece enjoyed the third-highest increase in Europe, after [[Finland]] and Ireland. Because of its strategic location, qualified workforce and political and economic stability, many multinational companies such as [[Ericsson]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Motorola]] and [[Coca-Cola]] have their regional research and development headquarters in Greece.

According to the official statistical body of Greece, the [[Hellenic Statistical Authority]] (ELSTAT), the country's total population in 2011 was 10,815,197.<ref name="ELSTAT">{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/ESYE/BUCKET/General/A1602_SAM01_DT_DC_00_2011_02_F_GR.pdf|script-title=el:Ανακοίνωση των αποτελεσμάτων της Απογραφής Πληθυσμού-Κατοικιών 2011 για το Μόνιμο Πληθυσμό της Χώρας|trans-title=Announcement of the results of the 2011 census on the population and housing of the permanent population of the country|language=el|publisher=[[Hellenic Statistical Authority]]|date=28 December 2011|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> The birth rate in 2003 stood at 9.5 per 1,000 inhabitants, significantly lower than the rate of 14.5 per 1,000 in 1981. At the same time, the mortality rate increased slightly from 8.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 to 9.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2003.

Greek society has changed rapidly over the last several decades. Its declining fertility rate has led to an increase in the median age, which coincides with the overall [[aging of Europe]]. In 2001, 16.71 percent of the population were 65 years old and older, 68.12 percent between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, and 15.18 percent were 14 years old and younger.<ref name="nssg">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gr/eng_tables/hellas_in_numbers_eng.pdf|title=Greece in Numbers|publisher=[[Hellenic Statistical Authority]]|year=2006|accessdate=14 December 2007|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040707190604/http://www.statistics.gr/eng_tables/hellas_in_numbers_eng.pdf|archivedate=7 July 2004}}</ref>

Marriage rates began declining from almost 71 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 until 2002, only to increase slightly in 2003 to 61 per 1,000 and then fall again to 51 in 2004.<ref name=nssg /> Moreover, divorce rates have seen an increase from 191.2 per 1,000 marriages in 1991 to 239.5 per 1,000 marriages in 2004.<ref name=nssg /> As a result of these trends, the average Greek family is smaller and older than in previous generations.

=== Cities ===
{{See also|List of cities in Greece}}
Almost two-thirds of the [[Greeks|Greek people]] live in urban areas. Greece's largest and most influential metropolitan centres are those of [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]], with metropolitan populations of approximately 4 million and 1 million inhabitants respectively. Other prominent cities with urban populations above 100,000 inhabitants include those of [[Patras]], [[Heraklion]], [[Larissa]], [[Volos]], [[Rhodes (city)|Rhodes]], [[Ioannina]], [[Chania]] and [[Chalcis]].<ref name="cities">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gr/Athena2001/Athena2001.ASP?wcu=$cmd=0$id=5200712142356520314915|title=Athena 2001 Census | publisher=[[National Statistical Service of Greece]]|accessdate=14 December 2007 | archiveurl =//web.archive.org/web/20080117231653/http://www.statistics.gr/Athena2001/Athena2001.ASP?wcu=$cmd=0$id=5200712142356520314915| archivedate = 17 January 2008}}{{Dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref>

The first textual evidence of the Greek language dates back to 15th century BC and the [[Linear B]] script which is associated with the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Civilization]].  Greek was a widely spoken [[lingua franca]] in the Mediterranean world and beyond during [[Classical Antiquity]], and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire.

During the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the [[Greek language question]], on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic [[Katharevousa]], created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language, or the [[Dimotiki]], the form of the [[Greek language]] which evolved naturally from [[Byzantine Greek language|Byzantine Greek]] and was the language of the people.  The dispute was finally resolved in 1976, when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language, and Katharevousa fell to disuse.

Greece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language.  Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]] dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the [[Greek genocide]] and constitute a sizable group. The [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]] dialect came to Greece due to the genocide as well, but is endangered and is barely spoken now. Indigenous Greek dialects include the archaic Greek spoken by the [[Sarakatsani]], traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of [[Greek Macedonia]] and other parts of [[Northern Greece]].  The [[Tsakonian language]], a distinct Greek language deriving from [[Doric Greek]] instead of [[Ionic Greek]], is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern Peloponnese.

The [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority]] in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population, consists of speakers of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ([[Pomaks]]){{Sfn | Trudgill | 2000}} and [[Romani language|Romani]].  Romani is also spoken by Christian [[Romani people|Roma]] in other parts of the country.  Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country.  Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority.  Today they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction.  This goes for the [[Arvanites]], an [[Albanian language|Albanian]]-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians|Moglenites]], also known as [[Vlachs]], whose language is closely related to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central Greece.  Members of these groups ethnically identify as Greeks<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.cilevics.eu/minelres/reports/greece/greece_NGO.htm | publisher = Greek Helsinki Monitor | title = Minority Rights Group, Greece, Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (along guidelines for state reports according to Article 25.1 of the Convention) | date = 8 September 1999}}</ref> and are today all at least bilingual in Greek.

Near the northern Greek borders there are also some [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]–speaking groups, locally known as ''Slavomacedonian''-speaking, most of whose members identify ethnically as Greeks. Their dialects can be linguistically classified as forms of either [[Macedonian language|Macedonian Slavic]] or [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].<ref name="Bulgarian language">{{cite web| url =http://www.omniglot.com/writing/bulgarian.htm |work=Writing |title=Bulgarian Language | publisher = Omniglot |accessdate=17 October 2010 |ref=harv}}{{unreliable source?|date=August 2011|reason=what is this site?  no wikipedia article. seems to be operated by an individual. surely a more mainstream source can be substituted?}}</ref><ref name="The Bulgarian language">{{cite web | location = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | url = http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/language/about/bulgarian.html | title = The Bulgarian Language | work= Kwintessential |accessdate=17 October 2010 | ref = harv}}</ref>  It is estimated that after the population exchanges of 1923, [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] had 200,000 to 400,000 Slavic speakers.<ref name="minorities">Roudometof, Victor; Robertson, Roland (2001).

Other notable minority languages include [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and the Greco-Turkic dialect spoken by the [[Urums]], a community of [[Caucasus Greeks]] from the [[Tsalka]] region of central Georgia and ethnic Greeks from southeastern [[Greeks in Ukraine|Ukraine]] who arrived in mainly Northern Greece as economic migrants in the 1990s.

=== Migration ===
{{Main|Greek Diaspora|Immigration to Greece}}
[[File:50 largest Greek diaspora.png|thumb|380px|A map of the fifty countries with the largest [[Greek diaspora]] communities.]]
Throughout the 20th century, millions of Greeks migrated to the [[Greek American|United States]], [[Greek Britons|United Kingdom]], [[Greek Australian|Australia]], [[Greek Canadians|Canada]], and [[Greeks in Germany|Germany]], creating a large [[Greek diaspora]]. Net migration started to show positive numbers from the 1970s, but until the beginning of the 1990s, the main influx was that of returning Greek migrants or of [[Pontic Greeks]] and others from [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]], [[Greeks in Georgia|Georgia]], [[Greeks in Turkey|Turkey]] the [[Greeks in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], and elsewhere in the former [[Soviet Bloc]].<ref name=eliamep>Triandafyllidou, Anna.

A study from the Mediterranean Migration Observatory maintains that the 2001 census recorded 762,191 persons residing in Greece without Greek citizenship, constituting around 7% of total population. Of the non-citizen residents, 48,560 were EU or [[European Free Trade Association]] nationals and 17,426 were Cypriots with privileged status. The majority come from Eastern European countries: Albania (56%), Bulgaria (5%) and Romania (3%), while migrants from the former Soviet Union (Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, etc.) comprise 10% of the total.<ref>Kasimis, Charalambos; Kassimi, Chryssa (June 2004).

There is also a considerable number of co-ethnics that came from the Greek communities of Albania and the former [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=eliamep />

Greece, together with [[Italy]] and Spain, is a major entry point for illegal immigrants trying to enter the EU.  Illegal immigrants entering Greece mostly do so from the border with [[Turkey]] at the [[Evros River]] and the islands of the eastern Aegean across from Turkey (mainly Lesbos, Chios, Kos, and Samos). In 2012, the majority of illegal immigrants entering Greece came from [[Afghanistan]], followed by [[Pakistan]]is and [[Bangladesh]]is.<ref>{{cite news|title=In crisis, Greece rounds up immigrants&nbsp;– Associated Press|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10403249|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 June 2013|date=22 August 2012|location=London}}</ref> In 2015 they have been joined by Syrians fleeing the [[Syrian civil war]].

Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in ''[[paideia]]'' (education). ''Paideia'' was one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world while the first European institution described as a university was founded in 5th century Constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the [[Fall of Constantinople|city's fall]] to the Ottomans in 1453.<ref name="texor">{{cite web|url= http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~bump/OriginUniversities.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090220164836/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~bump/OriginUniversities.html|archivedate= 2009-02-20 |title=Jerome Bump, University of Constantinople|accessdate=19 December 2008|work= The Origin of Universities |publisher= University of Texas at Austin }}</ref> The [[University of Constantinople]] was Christian Europe's first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught,<ref>{{cite book |last=Tatakes |first=Vasileios N. |author2=Moutafakis, Nicholas J. |title=Byzantine Philosophy |year=2003 |publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=0-87220-563-0|page=189}}</ref> and considering the original meaning of the world university as a corporation of students, the world’s first university as well.<ref name="texor"/>

Compulsory education in Greece comprises primary schools (Δημοτικό Σχολείο, ''Dimotikó Scholeio'') and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (Γυμνάσιο).  Nursery schools (Παιδικός σταθμός, ''Paidikós Stathmós'') are popular but not compulsory. [[Kindergarten]]s (Νηπιαγωγείο, ''Nipiagogeío'') are now compulsory for any child above 4 years of age. Children start primary school aged 6 and remain there for six years.  Attendance at gymnasia starts at age 12 and lasts for three years.

Greece's post-compulsory secondary education consists of two school types: unified upper secondary schools (Γενικό Λύκειο, ''Genikό Lykeiό'') and [[technical school|technical]]–[[vocational school|vocational]] educational schools (Τεχνικά και Επαγγελματικά Εκπαιδευτήρια, "TEE").  Post-compulsory secondary education also includes vocational training institutes (Ινστιτούτα Επαγγελματικής Κατάρτισης, "IEK") which provide a formal but unclassified level of education.  As they can accept both ''Gymnasio'' (lower secondary school) and ''Lykeio'' (upper secondary school) graduates, these institutes are not classified as offering a particular level of education.

According to the Framework Law (3549/2007), Public higher education "Highest Educational Institutions" (Ανώτατα Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα, ''Anótata Ekpaideytiká Idrýmata'', "ΑΕΙ") consists of two parallel sectors:the University sector (Universities, Polytechnics, Fine Arts Schools, the Open University) and the Technological sector (Technological Education Institutions (TEI) and the School of Pedagogic and Technological Education).  There are also State Non-University Tertiary Institutes offering vocationally oriented courses of shorter duration (2 to 3 years) which operate under the authority of other Ministries.  Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of ''Lykeio''.  Additionally, students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the [[Hellenic Open University]] through a form of lottery.  The [[National and Capodistrian University of Athens|Capodistrian University of Athens]] is the oldest university in the eastern Mediterranean.

The Greek education system also provides special kindergartens, primary and secondary schools for people with special needs or difficulties in learning.  Specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical, theological and physical education also exist.

{{Main|Culture of Greece|List of Greeks}}
[[File:Temple of Hephaestus.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Athens]].]]

The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years, beginning in [[Mycenaean Greece]] and continuing most notably into [[Classical Greece]], through the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and its [[Greek East]]ern continuation, the Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other cultures and nations, such as the [[Frankokratia|Latin and Frankish states]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Venetian Republic]], the [[Genoese Republic]], and the [[British Empire]] have also left their influence on modern Greek culture, although historians credit the [[Greek War of Independence]] with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single, cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture.

In ancient times, Greece was the birthplace of [[Western culture]].<ref>Mazlish, Bruce.

Theatre was born in Greece.<ref>Brockett, Oscar G. (1991) ''History of the Theatre'' (sixth edition).  Boston; London: [[Allyn & Bacon]].</ref> The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens]], which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its centre, where it was [[institution]]alised as part of a [[festival]] called the [[Dionysia]], which honoured the god [[Dionysus]]. [[Greek tragedy|Tragedy]] (late 6th century BC), [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] (486 BC), and the [[satyr play]] were the three [[drama]]tic [[genre]]s to emerge there.

During the Byzantine period, the theatrical art was heavily declined. According to Marios Ploritis, the only form survived was the folk theatre (''Mimos'' and ''Pantomimos''), despite the hostility of the official state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.24grammata.com/?p=32749 |title=Culture e-Magazine&nbsp;– Free eBooks&nbsp;– WebTV » Τo Θέατρο στο Βυζάντιο και την Οθωμανική περίοδο |publisher=24grammata.com |date=18 March 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> Later, during the Ottoman period, the main theatrical folk art was the ''[[Karagiozis]]''. The renaissance which led to the modern Greek theatre, took place in the [[Venetian Crete]]. Significal dramatists include [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] and [[Georgios Chortatzis]].

The modern Greek theatre was born after the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek independence]], in the early 19th century, and initially was influenced by the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama, such as the Italian opera. The [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]] was the first theatre and [[opera]] house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, [[Spyridon Xyndas]]' ''The Parliamentary Candidate'' (based on an exclusively Greek [[libretto]]) was performed. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the Athenian theatre scene was dominated by [[revues]], [[Musical theatre|musical comedies]], [[operettas]] and [[nocturnes]] and notable playwrights included [[Spyridon Samaras]], [[Dionysios Lavrangas]], [[Theophrastos Sakellaridis]] and others.

The [[National Theatre of Greece]] was founded in 1880. Notable playwrights of the modern Greek theatre include [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Pantelis Horn]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]] and [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], while notable actors include [[Cybele Andrianou]], [[Marika Kotopouli]], [[Aimilios Veakis]], [[Orestis Makris]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Manos Katrakis]] and [[Dimitris Horn]]. Significant directors include [[Dimitris Rontiris]], [[Alexis Minotis]] and [[Karolos Koun]].

=== Philosophy ===
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy|Modern Greek Enlightenment}}
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Bust of [[Plato]]. "The safest general characterisation of the [[Western philosophy|European philosophical tradition]] is that it consists of a series of footnotes to [[Plato]]." ([[Alfred North Whitehead]], ''[[Process and Reality]]'', 1929).]]

Most western philosophical traditions began in [[Ancient Greece]] in the 6th century BC.  The first philosophers are called "Presocratics," which designates that they came before [[Socrates]], whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought.  The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of their original writings survive, in some cases merely a single sentence.

A new period of philosophy started with Socrates.  Like the [[Sophists]], he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point.  Aspects of Socrates were first united from [[Plato]], who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system.

[[Aristotle]] of [[Stagira]], the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity.  But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience.  Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of [[Greek philosophy]] from other founders during ancient times were [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Skepticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/greekphi/|title=Ancient Greek Philosophy|work= Internet encyclopedia of philosophy}}</ref>

[[Byzantine philosophy]] refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the [[Byzantine Empire]], especially between the 8th and 15th centuries. It was characterised by a [[Christianity|Christian]] world-view, but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Neoplatonists]].

In modern period, [[Modern Greek Enlightenment|Diafotismos]] (Greek: Διαφωτισμός, "enlightenment", "illumination") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and its philosophical and political ideas. Some notable representatives were [[Adamantios Korais]], [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Theophilos Kairis]].

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Greek literature|Modern Greek literature}}
[[File:Giorgos Seferis 1963.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Giorgos Seferis]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature|1963 Nobel laureate in Literature]].]]

Greek literature can be divided into three main categories: Ancient, Byzantine and modern Greek literature.

At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of [[Homer]]: the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''.  Though dates of composition vary, these works were fixed around 800&nbsp;BC or after.  In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent. [[Lyrical poetry]], [[ode]]s, [[pastorals]], [[elegy|elegies]], [[epigrams]]; dramatic presentations of comedy and [[tragedy]]; [[historiography]], [[rhetorical]] treatises, philosophical dialectics, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period. The two major lyrical poets were [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]].  The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama.

Of the hundreds of [[tragedies]] written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived: those of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]].  The surviving plays by [[Aristophanes]] are also a treasure trove of comic presentation, while [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] are two of the most influential historians in this period.  The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers.

[[Byzantine literature]] refers to literature of the Byzantine Empire written in [[Attic Greek|Atticizing]], [[Medieval]] and early [[Modern Greek]], and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the Christian [[Middle Ages]].

[[Modern Greek literature]] refers to literature written in common Modern Greek, emerging from late Byzantine times in the 11th century.  The Cretan Renaissance poem ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature.  It is a verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553–1613).  Later, during the period of Greek enlightenment ([[Diafotismos]]), writers such as [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] prepared with their works the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] (1821–1830).

Leading literary figures of modern Greece include [[Dionysios Solomos]], [[Andreas Kalvos]], [[Angelos Sikelianos]], [[Emmanuel Rhoides]], [[Kostis Palamas]], [[Penelope Delta]], [[Yannis Ritsos]], [[Alexandros Papadiamantis]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Andreas Embeirikos]], [[Kostas Karyotakis]], [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]], [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], and [[Demetrius Vikelas]].  Two Greek authors have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]: [[George Seferis]] in 1963 and [[Odysseas Elytis]] in 1979.

=== Cinema ===
{{Main|Greek cinema}}
[[File:Theodoros Angelopoulos Athens 26-4-2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Director [[Theodoros Angelopoulos]], winner of the [[Palme d'Or]] in [[1998 Cannes Film Festival|1998]]]]
Cinema first appeared in Greece in 1896 but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907. In 1914 the ''Asty Films Company'' was founded and the production of long films began. ''Golfo'' (Γκόλφω), a well known traditional love story, is considered the first Greek [[feature film]], although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931 [[Orestis Laskos]] directed ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''Δάφνις και Χλόη''), containing the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad. In 1944 [[Katina Paxinou]] was honoured with the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.

The 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many to be a golden age of Greek cinema.  Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: [[Irene Papas]], [[Melina Mercouri]], [[Mihalis Kakogiannis]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]], [[Nikos Tsiforos]], [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Nikos Koundouros]], [[Ellie Lambeti]],  and others.  More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements.  Notable films were ''[[The Counterfeit Coin|Η κάλπικη λίρα]]'' (1955 directed by [[Giorgos Tzavellas]]), ''Πικρό Ψωμί'' (1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), ''[[O Drakos]]'' (1956 directed by [[Nikos Koundouros]]), ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955 directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis).

Cacoyannis also directed ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'' with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. [[Finos Film]] also contributed to this period with movies such as ''Λατέρνα, Φτώχεια και Φιλότιμο'', ''[[Madalena (film)|Madalena]]'', ''[[I theia ap' to Chicago|Η Θεία από το Σικάγο]]'', ''Το ξύλο βγήκε από τον Παράδεισο'' and many more.  During the 1970s and 1980s [[Theo Angelopoulos]] directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].

There were also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora, such as the Greek-French [[Costa-Gavras]] and the Greek-Americans [[Elia Kazan]], [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Alexander Payne]].

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Greek cuisine}}
[[File:Flickr - cyclonebill - Græsk salat.jpg|thumb|180px|Classic [[Greek salad]]]]

[[Greek cuisine]] is characteristic of the healthy [[Mediterranean diet]], which is epitomized by dishes of [[Cretan diet|Crete]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Sari |last=Edelstein |title=Food, Cuisine, and Cultural Competency for Culinary, Hospitality, and Nutrition Professionals |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lj0CeaIIETkC&pg=PA147 |accessdate=27 December 2011 |date=22 October 2010 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett |isbn= 978-0-7637-5965-0 |pages=147–49}}</ref> Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as [[moussaka]], [[stifado]], [[Greek salad]], [[fasolada]], [[spanakopita]] and [[souvlaki]].  Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like [[skordalia]] (a thick purée of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), [[lentil]] [[soup]], [[retsina]] (white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey).  Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as [[meze]] with various dips such as [[tzatziki]], grilled octopus and small fish, [[feta cheese]], [[dolmades]] (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various [[pulses]], [[olive]]s and cheese. [[Olive oil]] is added to almost every dish.

Sweet desserts such as [[galaktoboureko]], and drinks such as [[ouzo]], [[metaxa]] and a variety of wines including retsina.  Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island. It uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines: [[oregano]], [[Mentha|mint]], garlic, [[onion]], [[dill]] and [[bay laurel]] leaves. Other common herbs and spices include [[basil]], [[thyme]] and [[fennel]] seed. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use "sweet" spices in combination with meat, for example [[cinnamon]] and [[clove]]s in stews.

=== Music and dances ===

Greek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments during that period included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked string instrument, the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times.  Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the [[Roman Empire]], Middle East, and the [[Byzantine Empire]] also had effect on Greek music.

While the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] resisted any type of change.  Therefore, [[Byzantine music]] remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis), Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art.  However, this method which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic [[Byzantine chant]]; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power.

Along with the Byzantine (Church) chant and music, the Greek people also cultivated the [[Greek folk music|Greek folk song]] which is divided into two cycles, the [[Acritic songs|akritic]] and [[klephtic song|klephtic]]. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the [[akrites]] (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with [[Digenis Acritas|Digenes Akritas]]. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, ''paraloghes'' (narrative song or ballad), love songs, [[mantinada|mantinades]], wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people's struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.

The [[Heptanese]]an [[Greek folk music#Ionian Islands|kantádhes]] (καντάδες '[[serenade]]s'; sing.: καντάδα) became the forerunners of the Greek modern song, influencing its development to a considerable degree. For the first part of the next century, several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style. The most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the so-called Athenian serenades, and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια 'theatrical revue songs') in [[revue]], [[operetta]]s and [[nocturne]]s that were dominating Athens' theater scene.

[[Rebetiko]], initially a music associated with the lower classes, later (and especially after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It was the base of the later [[laïkó]] (song of the people). The leading performers of the genre include Apostolos Kaldaras, [[Grigoris Bithikotsis]], [[Stelios Kazantzidis]], [[George Dalaras]], [[Haris Alexiou]] and [[Glykeria]].

[[File:Maria Callas (La Traviata) 2.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Maria Callas]], one of the most renowned and influential [[opera]] singers of the 20th century]]
Regarding the classical music, it was through the [[Ionian islands]] (which were under western rule and influence) that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ([[Ionian School (music)|Heptanesean or Ionian School]], Greek: ''Επτανησιακή Σχολή''), established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], [[Spyridon Xyndas]], [[Spyridon Samaras]] and [[Pavlos Carrer]]. [[Manolis Kalomiris]] is considered the founder of the Greek National School of Music.

In the 20th century, Greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of [[avant garde]] and modern [[classical music]], with figures such as [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], and [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] achieving international prominence. At the same time, composers and musicians such as [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Manos Hatzidakis]], [[Eleni Karaindrou]], [[Vangelis]] and [[Demis Roussos]] garnered an international following for their music, which include famous [[film score]]s such as [[Zorba the Greek]], [[Serpico]], [[Never on Sunday]], [[America America]], [[Eternity and a Day]], [[Chariots of Fire]], [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|Blade Runner]], among others. [[Greek American]] composers known for their film scores include [[Yanni]] and [[Basil Poledouris]]. Notable Greek [[opera]] singers and [[classical music]]ians of the 20th and 21st century include [[Maria Callas]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Mario Frangoulis]], [[Leonidas Kavakos]], [[Dimitris Sgouros]] and others.

Greece participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] 35 times after its debut at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 Contest]]. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]], Greece won with the song "[[My Number One]]", performed by Greek-Swedish singer [[Elena Paparizou]]. The song received 230 points with 10 sets of 12 points from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Albania, Cyprus, Serbia & Montenegro, Sweden and Germany and also became a smash hit in different countries and especially in Greece. The [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|51st Eurovision Song Contest]] was held in [[Athens]] at the [[Olympic Indoor Hall]] of the [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex]] in [[Maroussi]], with hosted by [[Maria Menounos]] and [[Sakis Rouvas]].

Greece is the birthplace of the [[ancient Olympic Games]], first recorded in 776 BC in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], and hosted the modern [[Olympic Games]] twice, the inaugural [[1896 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. During the parade of nations Greece is always called first, as the founding nation of the ancient precursor of modern Olympics. The nation has competed at every [[Summer Olympic Games]], one of only four countries to have done so. Having won a total of 110 medals (30 gold, 42 silver and 38 bronze), Greece is ranked 32nd by gold medals in the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|all-time Summer Olympic medal count]].

=== Mythology ===
{{Main|Greek mythology}}
[[File:Jupiter Smyrna Louvre Ma13.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Zeus]] was the King of the ancient Greek [[dodekatheon]].]]

The numerous gods of the [[ancient Greek religion]] as well as the mythical heroes and events of the ancient Greek [[epic (genre)|epics]] (''[[The Odyssey]]'' and ''[[The Iliad]]'') and other pieces of art and literature from the time make up what is nowadays colloquially referred to as Greek mythology. Apart from serving a religious function, the mythology of the [[ancient Greeks|ancient Greek]] world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated.

The principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the [[Dodekatheon]], or the ''Twelve Gods'', who lived on the top of Mount Olympus. The most important of all ancient Greek gods was [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, who was married to [[Hera]], who was also Zeus's sister. The other Greek gods that made up the [[Twelve Olympians]] were [[Demeter]], [[Ares]], [[Poseidon]], [[Athena]], [[Dionysus]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Hephaestus]] and [[Hermes]]. Apart from these twelve gods, Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs, such as [[nymphs]] and other magical creatures.

=== Public holidays and festivals ===
{{Main|Public holidays in Greece}}
[[File:GreciaIdraEpitaffioKalami.jpg|thumb|Procession of the ''[[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]]'', [[Holy Friday]]]]

According to Greek law, every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. In addition, there are four mandatory official public holidays: 25 March (''Greek Independence Day''), [[Easter Monday]], 15 August (''Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin''), and 25 December (''[[Christmas]]''). 1 May (''[[Labour Day]]'') and 28 October (''[[Ohi Day]]'') are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year.

In addition to the national holidays, there are public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a "Patron Saint" parallel to "[[Name days in Greece|Name Days]]", or a "Liberation Day". On such days it is customary for schools to take the day off.

Notable festivals include [[Patras Carnival]], [[Athens Festival]] and various local wine festivals. The city of [[Thessaloniki]] is also home of a number of festivals and events. The [[International Thessaloniki Film Festival|Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] is one of the most important film festivals in [[Southern Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586|script-title=el:Διεθνές Φεστιβάλ Κινηματογράφου Θεσσαλονίκης - Προφίλ|trans-title=Thessaloniki International Film Festival - Profile|language=el|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref>
