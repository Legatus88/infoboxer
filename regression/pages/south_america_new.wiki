'''South America'''<!-- Only put in English phonetics, do not list "South America" in other languages --> is a [[continent]] located in the [[Western Hemisphere]], mostly in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], with a relatively small portion in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. It is also considered as a [[subcontinent]] of the [[Americas]],<ref name=britannica-southamerica>{{cite web|url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/555844/South-America|title = South America|work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref> which is the model used in Spanish-speaking nations and most of South America.

It is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the north and east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lie to the northwest. It includes twelve sovereign states – [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]] – and two non-sovereign areas – [[French Guiana]], an [[overseas department]] of [[France]], and the [[Falkland Islands]], a [[British Overseas Territory]] (though [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|disputed]] by Argentina). In addition to this, the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] may also be considered part of South America.

South America has an [[area]] of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its [[population]] as of 2005 has been estimated at more than 371,090,000. South America [[List of continents by population|ranks fourth]] in area (after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, [[Europe]], and North America). The most populous countries are Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru. <ref> http://statisticstimes.com/population/south-american-countries-by-population.php</ref> 

Most of the population lives near the continent's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the [[patagonia|far south]] are sparsely populated. The geography of western South America is dominated by the [[Andes]] mountains; in contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and large lowlands where rivers such as the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], [[Orinoco]], and [[Paraná River|Paraná]] flow. Most of the continent lies in the [[tropics]].

The continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long [[European colonization of the Americas|history of colonialism]], the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and societies and states commonly reflect [[Western culture|Western traditions]].

South America's major mineral resources are [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[iron ore]], [[tin]], and [[petroleum]]. These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.

South America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth. South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]], [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicuña]], and [[tapir]]. The Amazon rainforests possess high [[biodiversity]], containing a major proportion of the Earth's [[species]].

Brazil is the largest country in South America, encompassing around half of the continent's land area and population. The remaining countries and territories are divided among three regions: The [[Andean States]], [[the Guianas]] and the [[Southern Cone]].

===Outlying islands===
Traditionally, South America also includes some of the nearby islands. [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]], [[Trinidad]], [[Tobago]], and the [[federal dependencies of Venezuela]] sit on the northerly South American [[continental shelf]] and are often considered part of the continent. Geo-politically, the island states and overseas territories of the Caribbean are generally grouped as a part or subregion of North America, since they are more distant on the [[Caribbean Plate]], even though [[San Andrés (island)|San Andres]] and [[Providencia Island|Providencia]] are politically part of [[Colombia]] and [[Aves Island]] is controlled by [[Venezuela]].<ref name="North America Atlas"/><ref>[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=sameri&Rootmap=&Mode=d&SubMode=w South America Atlas] National Geographic</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas |title=United Nations Statistics Division- Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49) |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref>

Other islands that are included with South America are the [[Galápagos Islands]] that belong to [[Ecuador]] and [[Easter Island]] (in [[Oceania]] but belonging to [[Chile]]), [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]] (both Chilean) and [[Tierra del Fuego]] (split between Chile and [[Argentina]]). In the Atlantic, [[Brazil]] owns [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], and the [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], while the [[Falkland Islands]] are governed by the [[United Kingdom]], whose sovereignty over the islands is [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|disputed by Argentina]]. [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] may be associated with either South America or [[Antarctica]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==History==
{{Main|History of South America}}

===Prehistory===
{{further|History of South America#Pre-Columbian era}}
[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|240px|The prehistoric [[Cueva de las Manos]], or ''Cave of the Hands'', in Argentina.]]
South America is believed to have been joined with [[Africa]] from the late [[Paleozoic Era]] to the early [[Mesozoic Era]], until the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago. Therefore, South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers.

South America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] (now the [[Bering Strait]]) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day [[Russia]]. They migrated south through [[North America]], and eventually reached South America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]].

The first evidence for the existence of the human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC, when [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], [[chili pepper]]s and [[bean]]s began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a [[staple food]] today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC.<ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas">O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pp. 25</ref>

By 2000 BC, many [[agrarian society|agrarian]] communities had been settled throughout the [[Andes]] and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an [[agrarian society]].<ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas"/>

South American cultures began domesticating [[llama]]s, [[vicuña]]s, [[guanaco]]s, and [[alpaca]]s in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.<ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas"/>

===Pre-Columbian civilizations===

{{Main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}
[[File:80 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009 - edit.jpg|thumb|240px|The Inca estate of [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]] is one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World#Winners|New Seven Wonders of the World]]]]

The rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.

One of the earliest known South American civilizations was at [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], on the central [[Peru]]vian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by [[Chavin culture|Chavín]] by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chavín de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.

In the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] (100 BC&nbsp;– 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] (400 BC&nbsp;– 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through [[irrigation]] and new styles of ceramic art. At the [[Altiplano]], Tiahuanaco or [[Tiwanaku]] (100 BC&nbsp;– 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion.

Around 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or [[Wari culture|Huari]] Empire (600–1200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and tiahuanaco religious iconography.

The [[Muisca]] were the main indigenous civilization in what is now modern Colombia. They established a confederation of many clans, or cacicazgos, that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.

Other important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the [[Cañari]]s (in south central Ecuador), [[Chimú]] Empire (1300–1470, Peruvian northern coast), [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000–1450, Bolivia and southern Peru).

Holding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as ''Tawantin suyu'', and "the land of the four regions," in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture.

The [[Mapuche]] in Central and Southern Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the [[Arauco War]] for more than 300 years.

===European colonization===
{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Oscar Pereira da Silva - Desembarque de Pedro Álvares Cabral em Porto Seguro em 1500 (detalhe).jpg|thumb|240px|Portuguese arrival in Brazil in the Colonial era. "From Spaniard and Amerindian woman, begets Mestizo".]]

In 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.

The treaty established an imaginary line along a north-south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46° 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.

Beginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it in colonies.

European infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]]) – to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no immune resistance&nbsp;– and systems of forced labor, such as the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mit'a]], decimated the native population under Spanish control. After this, African [[Slavery|slaves]], who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.

The Spaniards were committed to convert their native subjects to [[Christianity]] and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with their established beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.

Eventually, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]] class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers.

Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of [[Latin America]]n.

[[Guyana]] was first a Dutch, and then a [[British Empire|British colony]], though there was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was colonized by the French. The country was once partitioned into three parts, each being controlled by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully by the British.

===Independence from Spain and Portugal===
{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|Independence of Brazil}}
[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Guayaquil conference]], between [[José de San Martín]] and [[Simón Bolívar]].]]
The European [[Peninsular War]] (1807–1814), a theater of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the [[House of Braganza]] avoided capture by [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|escaping to Brazil]]. Napoleon also captured King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]] to rule in the name of the captured king.

Many cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] between the [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]], who promoted such autonomy, and the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the [[Absolutist Restoration]] as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict.

The independence of South America was secured by [[Simón Bolívar]] (Venezuela) and [[José de San Martín]] (Argentina), the two most important ''[[Libertadores]]''. Bolívar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards [[Lima]], the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Meanwhile, San Martín led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, [[Ecuador]], where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.

In the Portuguese kingdom of Brazil and Algarve, [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King [[Dom João VI]], proclaimed the independent Kingdom of Brazil in 1822, which later became the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in [[Bahia]] and [[Pará]], independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil.

===Nation-building and balkanization===
The newly independent nations began a process of [[balkanization]], with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern day (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the [[Republic of Entre Ríos]] and the [[Riograndense Republic]]).

The [[Peru–Bolivian Confederation]], a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836–1839) and again during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883). Paraguay was virtually destroyed by Argentina and Brazil in the [[Paraguayan War]].

===Rise and fall of military dictatorships===
[[File:Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes firing a broadside.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The Brazilian [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|''Minas Geraes'' class]] kindled an [[South American dreadnought race|Argentine–Brazilian–Chilean naval arms race]].]]
Wars became less frequent in the 20th century, with Bolivia-Paraguay and Peru-Ecuador fighting the last inter-state wars.
Early in the 20th century, the [[ABC Powers|three wealthiest South American countries]] engaged in [[South American dreadnought race|a vastly expensive naval arms race]] which was catalyzed by the introduction of a new warship type, the "[[dreadnought]]". At one point, the Argentine government was spending a fifth of its entire yearly budget for just two dreadnoughts, a price that did not include later in-service costs, which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial purchase.<ref>Richard Hough, ''The Big Battleship'' (London: Michael Joseph, 1966), 19. {{oclc|8898108}}.</ref><ref>Robert Scheina, ''Latin America: A Naval History, 1810–1987'' (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987), 86. ISBN 0-87021-295-8. {{oclc|15696006}}.</ref>

The continent became a battlefield of the [[Cold War]] in the late 20th century. Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on [[Operation Condor|inter-state collaboration]]. Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of "National Security" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from [[Internal conflict in Peru|an internal conflict]].

Argentina and Britain fought the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.

Colombia has had an ongoing, though diminished internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation of [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] (FARC-EP) and then involved several illegal armed groups of leftist-leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords. Many of these are now defunct, and only a small portion of the ELN remains, along with the stronger, though also greatly reduced FARC. These leftist groups smuggle narcotics out of Colombia to fund their operations, while also using kidnapping, bombings, land mines and assassinations as weapons against both elected and non-elected citizens.

[[File:Presidentes unasur (cropped).jpg|thumb|240px|Presidents of [[UNASUR]] member states at the Second Brasília Summit on 23 May 2008.]]
Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships became common after [[World War II]], but since the 1980s, a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.<ref>"The Cambridge History of Latin America", edited by Leslie Bethell, Cambridge University Press (1995) ISBN 0-521-39525-9</ref> Nonetheless, allegations of corruption are still very common, and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments, although, in most occasions, regular civilian succession has continued.

[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] turned into a severe problem in late 1980s, and some countries, despite having strong democracies, have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without resorting to unorthodox economic policies, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|default]] in the early 21st century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Bethell|title=Bibliographical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNWbywFXhkC|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39525-0}}</ref>{{neutrality disputed|date=November 2012}} The last twenty years have seen an increased push towards [[Integration of Latin America|regional integration]], with the creation of uniquely South American institutions such as the [[Andean Community]], [[Mercosur]] and [[Unasur]]. Notably, starting with the election of [[Hugo Chávez]] in Venezuela in 1998, the region experienced what has been termed a [[pink tide]] – the election of several leftist and center-left administrations to most countries of the area, except for the Guianas and Colombia.

==Politics==

During the first decade of the 21st century, South American governments have drifted to the political left, with leftist leaders being elected in Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. Most South American countries are making an increasing use of protectionist policies, undermining a greater global integration but helping local development.

Recently, an intergovernmental entity has been formed which aims to merge the two existing customs unions: [[Mercosur]] and the [[Andean Community]], thus forming the third-largest trade bloc in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/sovereign/integrate/2008/1029newconsensus.htm |title=Globalpolicy.org |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref>
This new political organization known as [[Union of South American Nations]] seeks to establish free movement of people, economic development, a common defense policy and the elimination of [[tariff]]s.

==Ethnic demographics==

South America is also home to one of the largest populations of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]s.

South America relies less on the export of both manufactured goods and natural resources than the world average; merchandise exports from the continent were 16% of GDP on an [[nominal GDP|exchange rate]] basis, compared to 25% for the world as a whole.<ref name=wfex/> Brazil (the seventh largest economy in the world and the largest in South America) leads [[List of countries by exports|in terms of merchandise exports]] at $251 billion, followed by Venezuela at $93 billion, Chile at $86 billion, and Argentina at $84 billion.<ref name=wfex/>

The [[Economic inequality|economic gap]] between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than in most other continents. The richest 10% receive over 40% of the nation's income in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay,<ref name=share>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.DST.10TH.10|title=Income share held by highest 10%|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011}}</ref> while the poorest 20% receive 3% or less in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.DST.FRST.20/countries|title=Income share held by lowest 20%|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011}}</ref> This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie in the vicinity of skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments; nearly one in nine in South America live on less than $2 per day (on a [[purchasing power parity]] basis).<ref name=wb2/>

==Culture==

South Americans are culturally influenced by their indigenous peoples, the historic connection with the Iberian Peninsula and Africa, and waves of immigrants from around the globe.

South American nations have a rich variety of [[Latin American music|music]]. Some of the most famous genres include [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] from Colombia, [[pasillo]] from Ecuador, [[samba]], [[bossa nova]] and [[música sertaneja]] from Brazil, and [[tango music|tango]] from Argentina and Uruguay. Also well known is the non-commercial folk genre [[Nueva Canción]] movement which was founded in Argentina and Chile and quickly spread to the rest of the Latin America. People on the Peruvian coast created the fine [[guitar]] and [[cajon]] duos or trios in the most [[mestizo]] (mixed) of South American rhythms such as the Marinera (from Lima), the [[Tondero]] (from Piura), the 19th century popular Creole Valse or Peruvian Valse, the soulful Arequipan Yaravi, and the early 20th century Paraguayan [[Guarania (music)|Guarania]]. In the late 20th century, [[Rock en Español|Spanish rock]] emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. [[Music of Brazil|Brazil]] has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres.

The [[Spanish American literature|literature]] of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Gabriel García Márquez]] in novels and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] in other genres. The Brazilians [[Machado de Assis]] and [[João Guimarães Rosa]] are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writers.

Because of South America's broad ethnic mix, [[South American cuisine]] has African, South American Indian, Asian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], Brazil, is especially well known for its West African–influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and people in southern Chile, Bolivia and Brazil drink [[mate (beverage)|mate]], a herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, [[terere]], differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, African, Andean, and Amazonic food.

===Language===

South America shares with Europe the supremacy over the sport of football as all winners in [[FIFA World Cup]] history and all winning teams in the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] have come from these two continents. Brazil holds the record at the FIFA World Cup with five titles in total. Argentina and Uruguay have two titles each. So far four South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). The other three were Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978).
  
South America is home to the longest running international football tournament; the [[Copa América]], which has been regularly contested since 1916. Uruguay have won the Copa America a record 15 times, surpassing hosts Argentina in 2011 to reach 15 titles (they were previously equal on 14 titles each during the 2011 Copa America). The continent has produced many of the most famous and most talented players including Diego Maradona, Pelé, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Lionel Messi, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Teófilo Cubillas, Mario Kempes, Gabriel Batistuta, César Cueto, Enzo Francescoli, Arsenio Erico, Alberto Spencer, Carlos Valderrama, Elias Figueroa, Marcelo Salas, Juan Arango, Neymar, and Luis Suárez.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Also, in South America, a multi-sport event, the [[South American Games]], are held every four years. The first edition was held in [[La Paz]] in 1978 and the most recent took place in [[Santiago]] in 2014.
