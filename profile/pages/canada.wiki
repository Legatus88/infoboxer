'''Canada''' is a country, consisting of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]], in the northern part of the continent of North America. It extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98&nbsp;million square kilometres (3.85&nbsp;million square miles) in total, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country by total area]] and the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|fourth-largest country by land area]]. Canada's [[Canada–United States border|common border with the United States]] forms the world's longest land border.

The land now called Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]]. Beginning in the late 15th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonies]] were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of [[Military history of Canada|various conflicts]], the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]], on July 1, 1867, three colonies [[Confederation of Canada|joined]] to form the autonomous [[Canadian federalism|federal Dominion]] of Canada. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion]] of provinces and territories to the new self-governing [[Dominion]]. In 1931, Britain granted Canada near total independence with the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] and full sovereignty was attained when the [[Canada Act 1982]] severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]].

Canada is a [[federation|federal]] [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]], Queen [[Elizabeth II]] being the current head of state. The country is [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of 2015. Its advanced economy is [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|one of the largest in the world]], relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada's [[Canada–United States relations|long and complex relationship]] with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.

Canada is a [[developed country]] and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|tenth highest]] nominal per capita income globally, and the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|eighth highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]]. It [[International rankings of Canada|ranks among the highest]] in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth Realm]] member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and is furthermore part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings, including the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], the [[G8]], the [[Group of Ten (economic)|Group of Ten]], the [[G-20 major economies|G20]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Canada}}

Canada occupies most of the continent of North America, sharing [[land border]]s with the [[contiguous United States]] to the south (the longest border between two countries in the world) and the US state of [[Alaska]] to the northwest. Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean.<ref name="cia">

By total area (including its waters), Canada is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|second-largest country]] in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, Canada [[List of countries and outlying territories by land area|ranks fourth]]. The reason why Canada is in 4th place in terms of countries ranked by land area only is because Canada contains 60% of all the lakes in the world.<ref name="cia" /> The country lies between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41°]] and [[84th parallel north|84°N]], and longitudes [[52nd meridian west|52°]] and [[141st meridian west|141°W]].

===Law===
{{Main|Law of Canada}}
The [[Constitution of Canada]] is the supreme law of the country, and consists of written text and unwritten conventions. The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the [[British North America Acts|British North America Act]] prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] granted full autonomy and the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], ended all legislative ties to the UK, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government—though a [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] allows the federal parliament and provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bakan|first=Joel|author2=Elliot, Robin M|title=Canadian Constitutional Law|publisher=Emond Montgomery Publications|year=2003|pages=3–8, 683–687, 699|isbn=978-1-55239-085-6}}</ref>
